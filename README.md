# Code of Conduct Notifier Action

## Description
The challenge of managing online communities is continuously growing. Often times the members are spread across multiple platforms, making it harder to get a complete snapshot of its members' interactions and behavior. While platforms employ different tools and methods to moderate (potentially harmful) conversations, the moderators' priority will always be to create a safe and positive community experience for everybody. This Action aims to help just a little bit the GitHub communities moderators into enforcing their Code of Conduct.
